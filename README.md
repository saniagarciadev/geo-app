## Geo

![alt text](./assets/maps-evolved.png)

Geo is an endlessly customizable and social maps app.

Your data lives in open protocols only, so whenever you want you can take your connections and history elsewhere.

Using Geo should feel familiar but also dynamic, alive and sometimes surprising.

Early in development.

Closed alpha on Android coming 31 March.
